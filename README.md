## Missing in GitHub Webinterface

- Move image to another directory
- Create directory
    - Workaroud: Create temporary empty file
- Rename directory
- Move directory
- Move multiple files to another directory

## Idea: Create simple webinterface

- Target audience/user: non tech users like my sister
- Via API possible?
    - Research read
    - Research write
