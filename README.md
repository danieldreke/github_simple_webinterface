    - Workaroud: Create temporary empty file
- Rename directory
- Move directory
- Move multiple files to another directory

## Research
- Existing solutions / Github Apps:
  - [prose.io](https://prose.io/) looks promising, could be used as a start
    - https://github.com/prose/prose
    - \+ files can be edited
    - \- no preview of images
    - \- images cannot be renamed
    - \- folders cannot be created
  - siteleaf.com
    - \+ preview function
    - \- preview function costs money
    - \- files cannot be edited
    - \- folders cannot be created
    - \- focus is on blog pages and posts
- [codemirror.net](https://codemirror.net/) .. versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for the browser
